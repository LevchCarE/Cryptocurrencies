## Clustering Crypto

This project applies machine learning clustering techniques to the cryptocurrency market to uncover patterns and groupings among various coins and tokens.

### Overview

In the `crypto_clustering.ipynb` notebook, we implement an unsupervised learning approach to analyze and segment cryptocurrencies based on their market behavior and features. By leveraging clustering algorithms, such as K-Means or hierarchical clustering, we aim to:

- Identify groups of cryptocurrencies with similar price movements, volatility, or other features.
- Help investors or researchers better understand the structure of the crypto market.
- Visualize the clusters to gain insights into how different coins relate to each other.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Collect and preprocess historical price data and/or other relevant features for a set of cryptocurrencies.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Extract statistical features (e.g., returns, volatility) or use price/time-series data directly.
   
3. **Clustering Algorithm:**  
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group cryptocurrencies based on their similarities.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.
   - Plot and analyze cluster assignments.

5. **Interpretation:**  
   - Examine the characteristics of each cluster to derive actionable insights about different segments of the crypto market.

### Usage

- Run `crypto_clustering.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
- Modify the notebook to analyze new datasets or experiment with different clustering methods.

### Requirements

- Python (preferably 3.7+)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
